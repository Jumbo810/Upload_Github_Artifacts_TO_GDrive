    - name: Upload Artifacts TO Google Drive
      uses: Jumbo810/Upload_Github_Artifacts_TO_GDrive@v2.2.3
      with:
        target: <LOCAL_PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE>
        credentials: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS }}
        parent_folder_id: <YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>
```

### Upload multiple files using glob pattern:
```yaml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.1

    - name: Upload Multiple Files TO Google Drive
      uses: Jumbo810/Upload_Github_Artifacts_TO_GDrive@v2.2.3
      with:
        target: "dist/*.zip"
        credentials: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS }}
        parent_folder_id: <YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>
```

### Upload to a nested folder with custom name:
```yaml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.1

    - name: Upload to Nested Folder with Custom Name
      uses: Jumbo810/Upload_Github_Artifacts_TO_GDrive@v2.2.3
      with:
        target: build/app.jar
        name: application-${{ github.sha }}.jar
        credentials: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS }}
        parent_folder_id: <YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>
        child_folder: releases/${{ github.ref_name }}
```

### Upload with file override:
```yaml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.1

    - name: Upload with Override
      uses: Jumbo810/Upload_Github_Artifacts_TO_GDrive@v2.2.3
      with:
        target: build/latest.zip
        credentials: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS }}
        parent_folder_id: <YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>
        override: true
```

### Upload with custom ownership:
```yaml
steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.1

    - name: Upload with Custom Ownership
      uses: Jumbo810/Upload_Github_Artifacts_TO_GDrive@v2.2.3
      with:
        target: build/report.pdf
        credentials: ${{ secrets.YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS }}
        parent_folder_id: <YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID>
        owner: user@yourdomain.com
```

## Inputs

### `target` (Required):
Local path to the file to upload, can be relative from github runner current directory.

You can also specify a glob pattern to upload multiple files at once (this will cause the name property to be ignored).

### `credentials` (Required):
A service account public/private key pair encoded in base64.

[Generate and download your credentials in JSON format](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

Run `base64 my_service_account_key.json > encoded.txt` and paste the encoded string into a github secret.

### `parent_folder_id` (Required):
The id of the drive folder where you want to upload your file. It is the string of characters after the last `/` when browsing to your folder URL. You must share the folder with the service account (using its email address) unless you specify a `owner`.

### `name` (Optional):
The name of the file to be uploaded. Set to the `target` filename if not specified. (Ignored if target contains a glob `*` or `**`)

### `child_folder` (Optional):
A sub-folder where to upload your file. It will be created if non-existent and must remain unique. Useful to organize your drive like so:

```
ðŸ“‚ Release // parent folder
 â”ƒ
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ v1.0 // child folder
 â”ƒ â”” ðŸ“œ uploaded_file_v1.0
 â”ƒ
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ v2.0 // child folder
 â”ƒ â”” ðŸ“œ uploaded_file_v2.0
```

### `owner` (Optional):
The email address of a user account that has access to the drive folder and will get the ownership of the file after its creation. To use this feature you must grant your service account a [domain-wide delegation of authority](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation) beforehand.

### `override` (Optional):
If set true, delete files with the same name before uploading.

### `replace_mode` (Optional):
Determines how to handle existing files with the same name. Options:
- `delete_first`: Delete existing files before uploading (same as override=true)
- `update_in_place`: Update the existing file in place, preserving file ID and sharing links
- `add_new`: Create a new file even if one with the same name exists (default)

## Outputs

The action provides the following outputs that can be used in subsequent steps:

### Single File Upload:
- `file_id`: The ID of the uploaded file
- `file_name`: The name of the uploaded file
- `web_view_link`: The web view link to access the file in Google Drive
- `upload_count`: The number of files uploaded (will be "1")

### Multiple File Upload (using glob patterns):
- `file_ids`: Comma-separated list of file IDs
- `file_names`: Comma-separated list of file names
- `web_view_links`: Comma-separated list of web view links
- `upload_count`: The number of files uploaded

### Example usage of outputs:

```yaml
- name: Upload to Google Drive
  id: upload
  uses: Jumbo810/Upload_Github_Artifacts_TO_GDrive@v2.3.0
  with:
    credentials: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS }}
    parent_folder_id: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_PARENT_FOLDER_ID }}
    target: "./build/my-app.zip"
    
- name: Use the upload outputs
  run: |
    echo "File ID: ${{ steps.upload.outputs.file_id }}"
    echo "File Name: ${{ steps.upload.outputs.file_name }}"
    echo "Web View Link: ${{ steps.upload.outputs.web_view_link }}"
```

## Release Process

This project uses automated workflows to simplify the release process:

1. **Automatic Dist Updates**: After successful CI runs on the master branch, the `dist/index.js` file is automatically updated with the latest build artifact. This eliminates the need to manually download and replace the file before publishing.

2. **Creating a Release**:
   - Update the version in `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Merge changes to the master branch
   - Create and push a new tag: `git tag v2.2.3 && git push origin v2.2.3`
   - The release workflow will automatically:
     - Build the project
     - Create a GitHub release with notes from CHANGELOG.md
     - Attach the necessary files to the release

This automation ensures that the published action always contains the latest compiled code without manual intervention.

## Setting Up Google Drive API

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Drive API
4. Create a service account
5. Create a key for the service account (JSON format)
6. Base64 encode the JSON key file
7. Store the encoded key in a GitHub Secret
8. Share your Google Drive folder with the service account email

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure your credentials are correctly base64 encoded
   - Check that the service account has access to the specified folder

2. **File Not Found**
   - Verify that the target path is correct
   - Check if the file exists in your workflow environment

3. **Permission Denied**
   - Ensure the service account has write access to the folder
   - Check if domain-wide delegation is properly set up when using the owner parameter

4. **Multiple Files with Same Name**
   - Use the override parameter to replace existing files
   - Use unique filenames or add timestamps to avoid conflicts
